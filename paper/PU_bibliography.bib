	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are one of the most underrated conditions in critically ill patients. Despite the introduction of clinical practice guidelines and advances in medical technology, the prevalence of pressure ulcers in hospitalized patients continues to escalate. Currently, consensus is lacking on the most important risk factors for pressure ulcers in critically ill patients, and no risk assessment scale exclusively for pressure ulcers in these patients is available. OBJECTIVE: To determine which risk factors are most predictive of pressure ulcers in adult critical care patients. Risk factors investigated included total score on the Braden Scale, mobility, activity, sensory perception, moisture, friction/shear, nutrition, age, blood pressure, length of stay in the intensive care unit, score on the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, vasopressor administration, and comorbid conditions. METHODS: A retrospective, correlational design was used to examine 347 patients admitted to a medical-surgical intensive care unit from October 2008 through May 2009. RESULTS: According to direct logistic regression analyses, age, length of stay, mobility, friction/shear, norepinephrine infusion, and cardiovascular disease explained a major part of the variance in pressure ulcers. CONCLUSION: Current risk assessment scales for development of pressure ulcers may not include risk factors common in critically ill adults. Development of a risk assessment model for pressure ulcers in these patients is warranted and could be the foundation for development of a risk assessment tool.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We compared the sensitivity and specificity of the Norton, Waterlow, and Braden Scales in identifying patients at pressure sore risk. An additional goal was to determine whether or not the Care Dependency Scale (CDS) is able to detect patients at risk for pressure sore development. METHODS: The investigation was part of a prevalence study involving 754 patients in 3 Berlin hospitals. A questionnaire was used containing the subscales of the 3 risk calculators (Norton, Waterlow, and Braden), and the CDS. On the specified day nurses filled in the questionnaire using data obtained from the patients' charts and direct visualization of the patients' skin. RESULTS: Thirty-four out of 754 patients had at least 1 pressure ulcer. Comparing the 3 risk assessment tools, the Waterlow scale demonstrated the highest sensitivity (0.86) and the Norton scale demonstrated the highest specificity (0.75). Individuals with pressure sores were more likely to be care dependent (t-test: P< .01); 27 of them had a CDS score lower than 55. Using the score of 55 as the cut-off point, the CDS demonstrated a sensitivity of 0.74 and a specificity of 0.83. SUMMARY: This study demonstrated remarkable differences among the 3 commonly used risk assessment tools, in regards to sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, the CDS seems to have a diagnostic value similar to the 3 commonly used risk assessment calculators.},

	Abstract = {AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to determine the usability and utility of the Braden in intensive care units. BACKGROUND: An understanding of the clinical usage of the Braden Scale is valuable when considering the incidence of pressure ulcers in a critical-care setting. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 21,115 hospital-days of 715 inpatients in an intensive-care unit in 2006 in South Korea was applied to data extracted electronically from an electronic medical record system in October 2007. RESULTS: Of the 715 patients, 42 (5.9%) developed a pressure ulcer, corresponding to an incidence density of 198 ulcers per 1000 hospital-days. The usage rate of the Braden Scale was 11.26%, and an analysis of its utility, based on a receiver operating characteristic analysis with the cutoff set at 13, gave sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and negative predictive values of 75.9%, 47.3%, 18.1% and 92.8% respectively. There were weak correlations between the scores and nursing interventions except for the category of position changes. The variety of nursing interventions was also limited. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the Braden Scale has a very low usage rate and a low-to-moderate positive predictive performance. Our quantification of the relationship between Braden Scale score and nursing interventions indicates the need for a more comprehensive and fundamental approach to the use of this scale.},

	Abstract = {AIM: This paper reports a systematic review conducted to determine the effectiveness of the use of risk assessment scales for pressure ulcer prevention in clinical practice, degree of validation of risk assessment scales, and effectiveness of risk assessment scales as indicators of risk of developing a pressure ulcer. BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are an important health problem. The best strategy to avoid them is prevention. There are several risk assessment scales for pressure ulcer prevention which complement nurses' clinical judgement. However, some of these have not undergone proper validation. METHOD: A systematic bibliographical review was conducted, based on a search of 14 databases in four languages using the keywords pressure ulcer or pressure sore or decubitus ulcer and risk assessment. Reports of clinical trials or prospective studies of validation were included in the review. FINDINGS: Thirty-three studies were included in the review, three on clinical effectiveness and the rest on scale validation. There is no decrease in pressure ulcer incidence was found which might be attributed to use of an assessment scale. However, the use of scales increases the intensity and effectiveness of prevention interventions. The Braden Scale shows optimal validation and the best sensitivity/specificity balance (57.1%/67.5%, respectively); its score is a good pressure ulcer risk predictor (odds ratio = 4.08, CI 95% = 2.56-6.48). The Norton Scale has reasonable scores for sensitivity (46.8%), specificity (61.8%) and risk prediction (OR = 2.16, CI 95% = 1.03-4.54). The Waterlow Scale offers a high sensitivity score (82.4%), but low specificity (27.4%); with a good risk prediction score (OR = 2.05, CI 95% = 1.11-3.76). Nurses' clinical judgement (only considered in three studies) gives moderate scores for sensitivity (50.6%) and specificity (60.1%), but is not a good pressure ulcer risk predictor (OR = 1.69, CI 95% = 0.76-3.75). CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that the use of risk assessment scales decreases pressure ulcer incidence. The Braden Scale offers the best balance between sensitivity and specificity and the best risk estimate. Both the Braden and Norton Scales are more accurate than nurses' clinical judgement in predicting pressure ulcer risk.},

	Abstract = {LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Cite risk factors for pressure sore development. 2. Detail the pathophysiology of pressure sores. 3. List the types and classification of pressure sores. 4. Consider the various nonsurgical conservative wound management strategies. 5. Describe the appropriate surgical interventions for each pressure sore type. 6. Understand the causes of recurrent pressure sores and methods of avoiding recurrence. SUMMARY: Pressure sores are the result of unrelieved pressure, usually over a bony prominence. With an estimated 2.5 million pressure ulcers treated annually in the United States at a cost of $11 billion, pressure sores represent a costly and labor-intensive challenge to the health care system. A comprehensive team approach can address both prevention and treatment of these recalcitrant wounds. Consideration must be given to the patient's medical and socioeconomic condition, as these factors are significantly related to outcomes. Mechanical prophylaxis, nutritional optimization, treatment of underlying infection, and spasm control are essential in management. A variety of pressure sore patterns exist, with surgical approaches directed to maximize future coverage options. A comprehensive approach is detailed in this article to provide the reader with the range of treatment options available.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers remain a common health problem worldwide within the different health-care settings, especially in intensive care settings. AIMS: The aims of this were to systematically assess the recent prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers in intensive care patients (2000-2005), the factors related to pressure ulcer prevalence and incidence and the methodological rigour of studies about pressure ulcer prevalence and incidence in intensive care patients. METHODS: The research design involved a review of literature for the period of 2000 to 2005, focused on the prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers in intensive care patients. RESULTS: The analysis of published papers revealed variations in pressure ulcer prevalence in intensive care settings ranging from 4% in Denmark to 49% in Germany, while incidence ranged from 38% to 124%. There was a wide variation in the prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers in intensive care patients as evidenced in the studies examined. There is also a gap between theory and practice in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers which needs to be addressed. CONCLUSION: Further research is needed regarding the effectiveness of nursing care on pressure ulcer development and into treatments that may successfully prevent their occurrence in intensive care patients.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND:: The purpose of this study was to present a scientific reason for pressure ulcer risk scales: Cubbin\& Jackson modified Braden, Norton, and Waterlow, as a nursing diagnosis tool by utilizing predictive validity of pressure sores. METHODS:: Articles published between 1966 and 2013 from periodicals indexed in the Ovid Medline, Embase, CINAHL, KoreaMed, NDSL, and other databases were selected using the key word ``pressure ulcer''. QUADAS-II was applied for assessment for internal validity of the diagnostic studies. Selected studies were analyzed using meta-analysis with MetaDisc 1.4. RESULTS:: Seventeen diagnostic studies with high methodological quality, involving 5,185 patients, were included. In the results of the meta-analysis, sROC AUC of Braden, Norton, and Waterflow scale was over 0.7, showing moderate predictive validity, but they have limited interpretation due to significant differences between studies. In addition, Waterlow scale is insufficient as a screening tool owing to low sensitivity compared with other scales. CONCLUSION:: The contemporary pressure ulcer risk scale is not suitable for uninform practice on patients under standardized criteria. Therefore, in order to provide more effective nursing care for bedsores, a new or modified pressure ulcer risk scale should be developed upon strength and weaknesses of existing tools.},

@article{rollling,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: A pressure ulcer (PU), also referred to as a 'pressure injury', 'pressure sore', or 'bedsore' is defined as an area of localised tissue damage that is caused by unrelieved pressure, friction or shearing forces on any part of the body. PUs commonly occur in patients who are elderly and less mobile, and carry significant human and economic impacts. Immobility and physical inactivity are considered to be major risk factors for PU development and the manual repositioning of patients in hospital or long-term care is a common pressure ulcer prevention strategy. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this review were to:1) assess the effects of repositioning on the prevention of PUs in adults, regardless of risk or in-patient setting;2) ascertain the most effective repositioning schedules for preventing PUs in adults; and3) ascertain the incremental resource consequences and costs associated with implementing different repositioning regimens compared with alternate schedules or standard practice. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases to identify reports of the relevant randomised controlled trials: the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 06 September 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2013, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE (1948 to August, Week 4, 2013); Ovid EMBASE (1974 to 2013, Week 35); EBESCO CINAHL (1982 to 30 August 2013); and the reference sections of studies that were included in the review. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), published or unpublished, that assessed the effects of any repositioning schedule or different patient positions and measured PU incidence in adults in any setting. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS: We included three RCTs and one economic study representing a total of 502 randomised participants from acute and long-term care settings. Two trials compared the 30 masculine and 90 masculine tilt positions using similar repositioning frequencies (there was a small difference in frequency of overnight repositioning in the 90 masculine tilt groups between the trials). The third RCT compared alternative repositioning frequencies.All three studies reported the proportion of patients developing PU of any grade, stage or category. None of the trials reported on pain, or quality of life, and only one reported on cost. All three trials were at high risk of bias.The two trials of 30 masculine tilt vs. 90 masculine were pooled using a random effects model (I(2) = 69%) (252 participants). The risk ratio for developing a PU in the 30 masculine tilt and the standard 90 masculine position was very imprecise (pooled RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.10 to 3.97, P=0.62, very low quality evidence). This comparison is underpowered and at risk of a Type 2 error (only 21 events).In the third study, a cluster randomised trial, participants were randomised between 2-hourly and 3-hourly repositioning on standard hospital mattresses and 4 hourly and 6 hourly repositioning on viscoelastic foam mattresses. This study was also underpowered and at high risk of bias. The risk ratio for pressure ulcers (any category) with 2-hourly repositioning compared with 3-hourly repositioning on a standard mattress was imprecise (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.16, very low quality evidence). The risk ratio for pressure ulcers (any category) was compatible with a large reduction and no difference between 4-hourly repositioning and 6-hourly repositioning on viscoelastic foam (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02, very low quality evidence).A cost-effectiveness analysis based on data derived from one of the included parallel RCTs compared 3-hourly repositioning using the 30 masculine tilt overnight with standard care consisting of 6-hourly repositioning using the 90 masculine lateral rotation overnight. In this evaluation the only included cost was nursing time. The intervention was reported to be cost saving compared with standard care (nurse time cost per patient euro206.6 vs euro253.1, incremental difference euro-46.5; 95%CI: euro-1.25 to euro-74.60). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Repositioning is an integral component of pressure ulcer prevention and treatment; it has a sound theoretical rationale, and is widely recommended and used in practice. The lack of robust evaluations of repositioning frequency and position for pressure ulcer prevention mean that great uncertainty remains but it does not mean these interventions are ineffective since all comparisons are grossly underpowered. Current evidence is small in volume and at risk of bias and there is currently no strong evidence of a reduction in pressure ulcers with the 30 degrees tilt compared with the standard 90 masculine position or good evidence of an effect of repositioning frequency. There is a clear need for high-quality, adequately-powered trials to assess the effects of position and optimal frequency of repositioning on pressure ulcer incidence.The limited data derived from one economic evaluation means it remains unclear whether repositioning every 3 hours using the 30 masculine tilt is less costly in terms of nursing time and more effective than standard care involving repositioning every 6 hours using a 90 masculine tilt.},

@article{surface,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are a prevalent and global issue and support surfaces are widely used for preventing ulceration. However, the diversity of available support surfaces and the lack of direct comparisons in RCTs make decision-making difficult. OBJECTIVES: To determine, using network meta-analysis, the relative effects of different support surfaces in reducing pressure ulcer incidence and comfort and to rank these support surfaces in order of their effectiveness. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, using a literature search up to November 2016, to identify randomised trials comparing support surfaces for pressure ulcer prevention. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment and data extraction. We grouped the support surfaces according to their characteristics and formed evidence networks using these groups. We used network meta-analysis to estimate the relative effects and effectiveness ranking of the groups for the outcomes of pressure ulcer incidence and participant comfort. GRADE was used to assess the certainty of evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We included 65 studies in the review. The network for assessing pressure ulcer incidence comprised evidence of low or very low certainty for most network contrasts. There was moderate-certainty evidence that powered active air surfaces and powered hybrid air surfaces probably reduce pressure ulcer incidence compared with standard hospital surfaces (risk ratios (RR) 0.42, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.29 to 0.63; 0.22, 0.07 to 0.66, respectively). The network for comfort suggested that powered active air-surfaces are probably slightly less comfortable than standard hospital mattresses (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.94; moderate-certainty evidence). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first network meta-analysis of the effects of support surfaces for pressure ulcer prevention. Powered active air-surfaces probably reduce pressure ulcer incidence, but are probably less comfortable than standard hospital surfaces. Most prevention evidence was of low or very low certainty, and more research is required to reduce these uncertainties.},

@article{nutrition,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There have been few systematic reviews and no meta-analyses of the clinical benefits of nutritional support in patients with, or at risk of developing, pressure ulcers. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to address the impact of enteral nutritional support on pressure ulcer incidence and healing and a range of other clinically relevant outcome measures in this group. METHODS: Fifteen studies (including eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) of oral nutritional supplements (ONS) or enteral tube feeding (ETF), identified using electronic databases (including Pub Med and Cochrane) and bibliography searches, were included in the systematic review. Outcomes including pressure ulcer incidence, pressure ulcer healing, quality of life, complications, mortality, anthropometry and dietary intake were recorded, with the aim of comparing nutritional support versus routine care (e.g. usual diet and pressure ulcer care) and nutritional formulas of different composition. Of these 15 studies, 5 RCTs comparing ONS (4 RCTs) and ETF (1 RCT) with routine care could be included in a meta-analysis of pressure ulcer incidence. RESULTS: Meta-analysis showed that ONS (250-500 kcal, 2-26 weeks) were associated with a significantly lower incidence of pressure ulcer development in at-risk patients compared to routine care (odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.62-0.89, 4 RCTs, n=1224, elderly, post-surgical, chronically hospitalised patients). Similar results were obtained when a combined meta-analysis of ONS (4 RCT) and ETF (1 RCT) trials was performed (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.88, 5 RCTs, n=1325). Individual studies showed a trend towards improved healing of existing pressure ulcers with disease-specific (including high protein) versus standard formulas, although robust RCTs are required to confirm this. Although some studies indicate that total nutritional intake is improved, data on other outcome measures (quality of life) are lacking. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows enteral nutritional support, particularly high protein ONS, can significantly reduce the risk of developing pressure ulcers (by 25%). Although studies suggest ONS and ETF may improve healing of PU, further research to confirm this trend is required.},

@article{rollingrct,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pressure, from lying or sitting on a particular part of the body results in reduced oxygen and nutrient supply, impaired drainage of waste products and damage to cells. If a patient with an existing pressure ulcer continues to lie or bear weight on the affected area, the tissues become depleted of blood flow and there is no oxygen or nutrient supply to the wound, and no removal of waste products from the wound, all of which are necessary for healing. Patients who cannot reposition themselves require assistance. International best practice advocates the use of repositioning as an integral component of a pressure ulcer management strategy. This review has been conducted to clarify the role of repositioning in the management of patients with pressure ulcers. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of repositioning patients on the healing rates of pressure ulcers. SEARCH METHODS: For this second update we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register (searched 23 May 2012); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 5); Ovid MEDLINE (2010 to May Week 2 2012); Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations May 22, 2012); Ovid EMBASE (2010 to 2012 Week 20); and EBSCO CINAHL (2010 to 16 May 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing repositioning with no repositioning, or RCTs comparing different repositioning techniques, or RCTs comparing different repositioning frequencies for the review. Controlled clinical trials (CCTs) were only to be considered in the absence of RCTs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed titles and, where available, abstracts of the studies identified by the search strategy for their eligibility. We obtained full versions of potentially relevant studies and two authors independently screened these against the inclusion criteria. MAIN RESULTS: We identified no studies that met the inclusion criteria. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the widespread use of repositioning as a component of the management plan for individuals with existing pressure ulcers, no randomised trials exist that assess the effects of repositioning patients on the healing rates of pressure ulcers. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether repositioning patients improves the healing rates of pressure ulcers. The effect of repositioning on pressure ulcer healing needs to be evaluated.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To use an evidenced-based approach to better understand the management and treatment of pressure ulcers. BACKGROUND: Pressure sores are a cause of significant morbidity in the medical community. Although there are a multitude of preventative and treatment options, there remains some degree of uncertainty in the literature in defining the best way to treat and manage pressure sores. METHODS: An exhaustive literature search was performed using several electronic databases. The search revealed several identified modalities for treatment and/or prevention of pressure ulcers. We then assessed each modality individually for the level of evidence that exists in the most current literature, with preference given to more recent studies (2005 to present). RESULTS: We reviewed the most relevant, high-level evidence that exists for the following modalities for understanding, preventing, and treating pressure ulcers: wound cleansers, repositioning, negative pressure therapy, debridement, enteral and parenteral feeding, vitamin and mineral supplementation, specialized mattresses, ultrasound therapy, honey, cellular therapy, musculocutaneous and fasciocutaneous flap closure, and other miscellaneous therapies. CONCLUSIONS: Although many of these modalities are used, we encourage clinicians and health care providers to consider the evidence-based data when deciding how to most appropriately manage their patients' pressure sores.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: We develop predictive models enabling clinicians to better understand and explore patient clinical data along with risk factors for pressure ulcers in intensive care unit patients from electronic health record data. Identifying accurate risk factors of pressure ulcers is essential to determining appropriate prevention strategies; in this work we examine medication, diagnosis, and traditional Braden pressure ulcer assessment scale measurements as patient features. In order to predict pressure ulcer incidence and better understand the structure of related risk factors, we construct Bayesian networks from patient features. Bayesian network nodes (features) and edges (conditional dependencies) are simplified with statistical network techniques. Upon reviewing a network visualization of our model, our clinician collaborators were able to identify strong relationships between risk factors widely recognized as associated with pressure ulcers. METHODS: We present a three-stage framework for predictive analysis of patient clinical data: 1) Developing electronic health record feature extraction functions with assistance of clinicians, 2) simplifying features, and 3) building Bayesian network predictive models. We evaluate all combinations of Bayesian network models from different search algorithms, scoring functions, prior structure initializations, and sets of features. RESULTS: From the EHRs of 7,717 ICU patients, we construct Bayesian network predictive models from 86 medication, diagnosis, and Braden scale features. Our model not only identifies known and suspected high PU risk factors, but also substantially increases sensitivity of the prediction - nearly three times higher comparing to logistical regression models - without sacrificing the overall accuracy. We visualize a representative model with which our clinician collaborators identify strong relationships between risk factors widely recognized as associated with pressure ulcers. CONCLUSIONS: Given the strong adverse effect of pressure ulcers on patients and the high cost for treating pressure ulcers, our Bayesian network based model provides a novel framework for significantly improving the sensitivity of the prediction model. Thus, when the model is deployed in a clinical setting, the caregivers can suitably respond to conditions likely associated with pressure ulcer incidence.},

In total, 61 risk factors for pressure ulcers were extracted from nine different report forms and analyzed using univariate and multiple linear regression analyses. The univariate analysis identified 33 significant factors, and 11 factors remained significant in the multiple regression analysis. Patients with decreased consciousness and those on ventilators tended to develop pressure ulcers during the early stage of hospitalization. Patients taking sedative-hypnotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, and anticoagulants, those in renal failure, and those who consulted a nutritionist, or had a gastrointestinal or tracheostomy tube or diarrhea tended to develop pressure ulcers at a later stage of hospitalization.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to describe present-on-admission pressure injuries (POA-PIs) in community-dwelling adults admitted to acute care. The specific aims of the study were to (1) measure the prevalence of POA-PIs during a 1-year period; (2) determine prehospital location of patients with POA-PIs; and (3) describe demographics, pressure injury (PI) characteristics, risk factors, and posthospital outcome of community-dwelling adults with PIs admitted to hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive study. SUBJECTS AND SETTING: The study sample was identified from a PI registry, a database maintained for quality improvement, at an 860-bed urban academic medical center in New England. The majority (n = 1022, 76.1%) were admitted to hospital from the community; and the remaining (23.9%) were admitted from long-term care facilities. METHODS: All subjects were assessed by certified wound nurses. Data were extracted electronically from selected standardized electronic health record (EHR) fields, representing variables of interest. Descriptive statistics were analyzed using percentages, means, and medians. RESULTS: The prevalence of patients admitted to acute care with a POA-PI was 7.4%. Community-dwelling subjects with POA-PIs had a mean age of 72.7 +/- 15.4 years; 52.4% were male, 80.3% white, 30.9% lived alone, 99.2% were insured, and 30.6% were college educated. They presented with a mean of 1.46 PIs; 37.5% were full thickness. Admission Braden Scale for Pressure Sore Risk scores indicated that 77% were at risk for PI; subscores indicated mobility limitations in 90.8% and inadequate/poor nutrition in 41.3%. Subjects had multiple comorbid conditions (mean 18.4 +/- 5.3 admission diagnoses). Only 21.4% were receiving home care services prior to admission. More than half (51.5%) were discharged to a healthcare facility, 33% to home, and 14% died or received hospice care. The 30-day readmission rate was 15.5%. CONCLUSION: The overall prevalence of POA-PIs on hospital admission in this study was higher than previous published reports. The majority arrived from community-dwelling locations. The severity of community-dwelling POA-PIs was higher than known benchmarked hospital-acquired PI severity. This real-world profile of community-dwelling patients with PI suggests that these individuals are considerably vulnerable and underserved by home care services. Opportunities exist for community PI screening, prevention, and intervention.},

	Abstract = {The objectives of the study were to examine the prevalence of pressure ulcers and hospital‐acquired pressure ulcers (HAPU) and identify modifiable factors in patients who develop HAPU as the basis for subsequent quality assurance studies and improvement in hospital care. The study was conducted in five hospitals in two Swedish County Councils. A 1‐day prevalence study (n = 1192) using the standards of the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel and Collaborative Alliance for Nursing Outcomes was conducted. The prevalence of ulcers was 14·9\% and 11·6\% were HAPU. Older age, more days of hospitalisation, less activity, problems with shear and friction and reduced sensory perception contributed significantly to HAPU. Pressure ulcer prevention strategies used more often in those with HAPU were risk assessment at admission, provision of a pressure relief mattress, having a turning schedule and using a heel or chair cushion. The prevalence of pressure ulcers continues to be a significant issue in acute care and the prevalence of HAPU is high. There is significant room for quality improvement in pressure ulcer prevention in Swedish hospitals. Future research needs to address both HAPU and community‐acquired pressure ulcers and focus on preventive strategies, including when they are initiated and which are effective in mitigating the high HAPU rate.},

	Abstract = { Background: The documentation of patient data on health records is a vital component of the care process. Accurate and complete recording of this data is a necessary practice. The adoption of electronic health records to improve the quality of nursing documentation is on the rise. Objectives: This study compares the accuracy and completeness of pressure ulcer data documentation between electronic and paper records. Design: A descriptive, comparative design with a retrospective review of patient records. Settings and sample: Two hospitals were chosen purposefully, one using electronic recording of patient data and the other using paper records. Methods: In the first phase, all hospitalised patients aged 18 years and over were inspected for pressure ulcers. In the second phase, the files of patients with pressure ulcers were audited. Results: Of the 52 patients with ulcers found in the hospital that used an electronic system, 43 of their records documented the pressure ulcers (83\%). Of the 55 patients with pressure ulcers in the hospital using paper records, 39 files had corresponding documentation of the presence of a pressure ulcer (71\%). Conclusion: In terms of accuracy and completeness, more comprehensive documentation practice was found on the electronic health records compared with paper records. However, both types of systems have shortcomings in the practice of pressure ulcer data documentation. },

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the accuracy in recording of pressure-ulcer prevalence and prevention before and after implementing an electronic health record (EHR) with templates for pressure-ulcer assessment. METHODS: All inpatients at the departments of surgery, medicine and geriatrics were inspected for the presence of pressure ulcers, according to the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel-methodology, during 1 day in 2002 (n = 357) and repeated in 2006 (n = 343). The corresponding patient records were audited retrospectively for the presence of documentation on pressure ulcers. RESULTS: In 2002, the prevalence of pressure ulcers obtained by auditing paper-based patient records (n = 413) was 14.3%, compared with 33.3% in physical inspection (n = 357). The largest difference was seen in the geriatric department, where records revealed 22.9% pressure ulcers and skin inspection 59.3%. Four years later, after the implementation of the EHR, there were 20.7% recorded pressure ulcers and 30.0% found by physical examination of patients. The accuracy of the prevalence data had improved most in the geriatric department, where the EHR showed 48.1% and physical examination 43.2% pressure ulcers. Corresponding figures in the surgical department were 22.2% and 14.1%, and in the medical department 29.9% and 10.2%, respectively. The patients received pressure-reducing equipment to a higher degree (51.6%) than documented in the patient record (7.9%) in 2006. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy in pressure-ulcer recording improved in the EHR compared with the paper-based health record. However, there were still deficiencies, which mean that patient records did not serve as a valid source of information on pressure-ulcer prevalence and prevention.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers are associated with substantial health burden, but could be preventable. Hospital-acquired pressure ulcers (HAPUs) prevention has become a priority for all healthcare settings, as it is considered a sign of quality of care providing. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients are at higher risk for HAPUs development. Despite the availability of published prevention strategies, there is a little evidence about which strategies can be safely integrated into routine standard care and have an impact on HAPUs prevention. AIMS: The aim was to synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of single strategies designed to reduce the incidence and prevalence of HAPUs development in ICUs. METHODS: The search strategy was designed to retrieve studies published in English across CINAHL, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, Scopus, and Mednar between 2000 and 2015. All adult ICU participants were aged 18 years or over. This review included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental and comparative studies. The studies that were selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review using standardized critical-appraisal instruments. RESULTS: The review included 25 studies, and the meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of a silicon foam dressing strategy in reducing HAPUs incidence (effect size = 4.62; 95% CI: 0.05-0.29; p < .00001, effect size = 4.50; 95% CI: 0.05-0.31; p = .00001, respectively) in critically ill patients. Evidence of the effectiveness of nutrition, skin-care regimen, positioning and repositioning schedule, support surfaces, and the role of education in prevention of HAPUs development in the ICU was limited, which precludes strong conclusions. LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION: The review provides an evidence-based guide to future priorities for clinical practice. In particular, a silicone foam dressing has positive impact in reducing sacrum and heel HAPUs incidence in the ICU.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to identify pressure ulcer (PU) incidence and risk factors that are associated with PU development in patients in two adult intensive care units (ICU) in Saudi Arabia. A prospective cohort study design was used. A total of 84 participants were screened second daily basis until discharge or death, over a consecutive 30-day period, out of which 33 participants with new PUs were identified giving a cumulative hospital-acquired PU incidence of 39.3% (33/84 participants). The incidence of medical devices-related PUs was 8.3% (7/84). Age, length of stay in the ICU, history of cardiovascular disease and kidney disease, infrequent repositioning, time of operation, emergency admission, mechanical ventilation and lower Braden Scale scores independently predicted the development of a PU. According to binary logistic regression analyses, age, longer stay in ICU and infrequent repositioning were significant predictors of all stages of PUs, while the length of stay in the ICU and infrequent repositioning were associated with the development of stages II-IV PUs. In conclusion, PU incidence rate was higher than that reported in other international studies. This indicates that urgent attention is required for PU prevention strategies in this setting.},

	Abstract = {AIMS: To determine incidence of pressure ulcers in patients at risk according to the Waterlow scale in intensive care units and to evaluate the effects of risk factors in critically ill patients. BACKGROUND: Pressure ulcers continue to be an important health problem that increases the risk of illness and death, extends patients' length of hospital stay and increases healthcare expenses. DESIGN: The study was conducted as a descriptive and prospective study. METHOD: The sample consisted of 140 patients. Data were collected using a data collection form, the skin assessment instrument and the Waterlow scale. RESULTS: The incidence of pressure ulcers in intensive care unit patients was found to be 14.3%. The majority of pressure ulcers (74%) were grade I. The mean length of time for pressure ulcer development was found to be 10.4 (SD 1.85) days. A statistically significant difference was found in the patients for pressure ulcer development according to their level of consciousness, activity, cooperation, length of stay, Waterlow scale score and C-reactive protein level. In the multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis, the most influential factors for pressure ulcer development were determined to be length of stay and activity level. CONCLUSIONS: Extra care needs to be taken to prevent pressure ulcer development in intensive care unit patients who have an extended length of stay, are dependent for activities, have high Waterlow scores, are unconscious and are not cooperative. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study determined the incidence of and factors that can affect the development of pressure ulcers in intensive care unit patients who are in a high risk group for the development of pressure ulcers and presented the importance of having Turkish nurses implement interventions directed at these factors.},

Critical care patients are at high risk for development of pressure ulcers because of the increased use of devices, hemodynamic instability, and the use of vasoactive medications. This article addresses risk factors, risk scales such as the Norden, Braden, Waterlow, and Jackson-Cubbin scales used to determine the risk of pressure ulcers in critical care patients, and prevention of device-related pressure ulcers in patients in the critical care unit.},
